# eventloopblocking

This is simple demo to show event loop blocking of sync vs async fs methods.

The "testData.html" is just here to exercise fs.readFile and fs.readFileSync. It also happens to be the html for node fs docs :)

To use this, simply run "npm i" (to get fs-promise) and then run "node index.js" from the console.
